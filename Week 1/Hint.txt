HINT: Use Binary search

Q)Help Fredo

HINT 1:
The given condition will be satisfied for all values above the x that we need to find 
and will not be satisfied for all values below it.

HINT 2: 
USE log!  here range of a[i] is upto 10^10 so if array elements are 10^9*10^8.....
product will be very very large!!  

Q) AGGRCOW

HINT 1:

Can you write code to answer the following question: Check whether it is possible to place cows 
in a way so that the distance between two cows is at least X.

HINT 2:

This can be done in O(N).

HINT 3:

According to the question I have to find the largest X. Doesn't it look like that we can use binary search? 
Indeed, smaller the X greater is the chance of it being a valid configuration. Doesn't this function 
look to be monotonic? Does it change it's value(possible or not possible) from interval to interval?
